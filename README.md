Check in what Lunar Year you were born

Hi everyone,
 I'm trying to make a speech recognition based program challenge here
 The first file is in Java (tahunCina.java)
 How it should function is:
  1. The program asked for what year you were born,
  2. The user says the year (in numbers 1 by 1)
  3. The program recognized the speech, 
  4. and display the Lunar year.
 Lets do it
 
 Feel free to use the original codes in here.
